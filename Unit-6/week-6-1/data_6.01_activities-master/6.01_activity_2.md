# 6.01 Activity 2

- For this activity create a new Tableau public file.
- Import the spatial data from the `files_for_activities/London_Boroughs_Spatial_File/` folder.
- Add a new connection and import the `carbon-emissions-borough.xls` (from the `files_for_activities` folder) file into Tableau.
- How are the two data sources that you imported, linked to each other?
- Save the file as `London Borough Tableau`. We will use this file again later in the lesson.
