# 6.01 Activity 3

- In this exercise, you will use the spatial file `files_for_activities/London_Boroughs_Spatial_File/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp` and the `files_for_activities/carbon-emissions-borough.xls` and then try to create a join between the two tables. Use the correct columns in each table to join the tables.

**Note**: We have not talked about this form of the join using Tableau. This is very similar to the join in SQL. If you would drag table 2 to the right of table 1, the Tableau will automatically show you how to join the two tables. Try to figure it out with the help of your peers and instructional staff.

- Create a plot to show the total _CO2_ emissions for the year _2014_ for all the London districts given in the data.
- Explore the data and see if you can find some interesting insight.
