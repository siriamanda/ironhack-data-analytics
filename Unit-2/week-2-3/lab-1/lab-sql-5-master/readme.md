# Lab | SQL Queries 5

In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).

The database is structured as follows:

### Instructions

1. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
2. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
3. Add rental for movie "Academy Dinosaur" by Charlotte Hunter from Mike Hillyer at Store 1 today.
4. Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` the user was deleted.
